    On this platform teachers can create test
    assignments that students complete through the application.
    During the exam, the application utilizes a camera, microphone,
    and screen capture to monitor students in real-time. This data
    is analyzed using artificial intelligence to prevent cheating and
    identity substitution. Students can view their grades and test
    history, while teachers have access to detailed reports on
    student performance. The platform is currently in the early
    stages of development, so a complete list of technologies has
    not yet been established.
